insurance decision-making.

GeoRisk makes no guarantees regarding:
- The occurrence or timing of sinkhole events

- The completeness of satellite coverage
- The suitability of thresholds for specific use cases

Users are responsible for validating outputs against ground-truth data and
local geological expertise before making underwriting or claims decisions.
