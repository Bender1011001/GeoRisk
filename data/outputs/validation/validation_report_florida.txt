VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
======================================================================
1. Ground Truth: Official state sinkhole databases (FGS, etc.)
2. Matching: Spatial proximity within 5km radius
3. Metrics: Standard information retrieval metrics
4. Note: Gravity data has ~1km resolution, limiting spatial precision

This validation uses DOCUMENTED, VERIFIED sinkholes only.
Actual sinkhole count is likely higher (unreported events).
