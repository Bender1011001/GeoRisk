Region: Florida

======================================================================
SUMMARY METRICS
======================================================================
Known Sinkholes (Ground Truth):  20
Total Predictions:               3

True Positives (Matched):        0
False Positives (Spurious):      3
False Negatives (Missed):        20

PRECISION:  0.0%  (of our predictions, how many are real)
RECALL:     0.0%  (of real sinkholes, how many did we find)
F1 SCORE:   0.000  (harmonic mean)

Mean Distance to Match:   inf km
Median Distance to Match: inf km

======================================================================
INTERPRETATION
======================================================================
[XX] LOW RECALL: Missing majority of known sinkholes
[!!] LOW PRECISION: High false alarm rate (expected for regional detection)

VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
======================================================================
1. Ground Truth: Official state sinkhole databases (FGS, etc.)
2. Matching: Spatial proximity within 5km radius
3. Metrics: Standard information retrieval metrics
4. Note: Gravity data has ~1km resolution, limiting spatial precision

This validation uses DOCUMENTED, VERIFIED sinkholes only.
Actual sinkhole count is likely higher (unreported events).
